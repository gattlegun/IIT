						<h2>GLOBAL - NETWORKING AND ARCHIVING IN YOUR LOCAL AREA</h2>
						<h3>so what is global?</h3>
						<p>
						“Global” is a project aiming to provide a way to help provide data for archivists and historians in a fun and engaging package that’s easy to pick up for the average user. It will be an app that allows someone to take a picture at any location and upload it to a server with metadata about the picture’s location and time taken. This data is processed to provide a time capsule of the area, allowing anyone to see how a given area looked a couple weeks, months, or even years ago in the past! It innovates on similar platforms such as Google Maps or Snap Maps by introducing elements of these existing ,services and merging them into one focused app. 
						</p>
						<h3>what's the motivation behind it?</h3>
						<p>In the current modern age of the internet, we consider the web to be ‘semantic,’ where information flows from one place to another seamlessly. There are plenty of platforms and services that already exist to archive internet data and massive servers that store the blog data of the average person (social media services like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) however these platforms have poor methods of presenting this information semantically. Snapchat product focus is on being in the moment and has content only publicly viewable for 24 hours, Twitter metadata is incoherent and fails to display frequently, and the presence of location metadata on Facebook is barely visible. From <a href="https://www.bondcap.com/report/it19/">Mary Meekers Annual “Internet Trends” presentation in 2019</a>, there is stated to be 236,000 neighbourhoods (1 neighbourhood = ~750-100) of the ‘Nextdoor’ platform - a service that helps promote segments of your local area. This user count was a staggering 2x increase over the past two years, demonstrating that there is large increase in demand of knowledge about a local area. From the same presentation, It is shown that that images and multimedia are the majority of a platforms engagement. Over 50% of Twitters impressions are through images and videos, Instagram - a platform solely built around sharing images and videos - has grown to a user base of 1 Billion in just 8 years. The model of ‘Image Creation + Sharing’ has lead to be highly sustainable and proves to be a market that is highly active. A social platform built around geolocation and memories can is highly desirable for users, historians, and external businesses such as advertising agencies. It puts meaning into the content generated by users and provides an interactive platform to engage with, links content into geospatial categories allowing future historians to easily work with datasets about locational activity, and can generate data that can be farmed out to external agencies for targeted advertising. </p>
						<h3>Describe in detail the features of your product.</h3>
						<p>The minimal viable product for ‘Global’ needs to consist of a map that can display photos taken at any given location and provide different methods of displaying this information. We can segment the app into sections known as ‘views,’ in this case; the Map view, Camera view, User view and Explore view.</p>
						<h4>the map view</h4>
						<p>The Map view is the first thing the user should see and contains everything needed to understand the program, there will be a camera button to let the user capture images in the program and upload natively. In the upload schema, users can access input fields for a wide array of metadata, the ability to input further location details such as a shop at a shopping centre or the name of a specific event that a GPS can’t identify just by locational tracking, adding a category to the event and/or image, and the ability to tag users. When the user interacts with a location, they will be given the option to scroll through images based on a timeline, or see a collection of the most recent images. Further functionality can be added to the product with the addition of social media syncing, instead of making the user upload all their images manually or start afresh, they can import photos and videos from pre-exisiting social media services and add them to their profile. </p>
						<h4>the camera view</h4>
						<p>The Camera view should use the devices native camera views and feature basic elements such as camera flipping, capture/record button, the ability to retake an image, and flash.  Afterwards, users should flow into a simple image editor where users can crop an image, add text, or draw onto the image to add flair to images. The ability to edit images heavily is not a heavy concern as one of the concerns the solution is addressing is indexing data for historical purposes, not just as a social networking platform.</p>
						<h4>the user view</h4>
						<p>The User view should contain elements to create a profile and interact with others, it should display a profile picture and banner, list of friends, and a gallery of images one has uploaded. With this feature suite should be a basic features to manage it; uploading and cropping profile pictures and banners, adding/removing/blocking friends, following interests (a collection of events in a specific field), linking social media, and privacy options to hide photos from certain groups of users - however most of these features exceed the minimal viable product with exception of creating a user account with a name. </p>
						<h4>the explore view</h4>
						<p>The Explore view displays events happening locally that users are taking a high amount of images at, popular events globally based on a users followed categories, and recent areas a users friend has visited. Interacting with any events shown on the explore view should lead users back to the map view for that event.</p>
						<h3>Describe the software, hardware, and/or other equipment needed for your product.</h3>
						<h4>hardware</h4>
						<p>The hardware needed to host the Global software backend can be handled through Amazon Web Services and their SaaS computes and running the database through their AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) which can connect easily to any other AWS app. Using AWS as the hardware for our server stack means the service is easily scalable and can be adjusted to meet user demand.</p>
						<h4>software</h4>
						<p>The software stack for Global will be primarily build on React Native, by using React, the service can be as platform agnostic as possible and minimal work is required to bring the experience to both desktop and mobile platforms. The benefits of using a web oriented language such as React is the wide variety of open source components that can be used in our application such as react-native-vision-camera and react-simple-image-editor. A major component of Global is the map view as images are tagged at a location and the ui is centred around a map design, to retrieve the data needed for these operations, the Global system will use the Google Maps API. The relational database needed to operate Globals backend will be run on MySQL through AWS RDS as it is a scalable, performant, and open source software that can return queries at high speeds for the best possible experience.</p>
						<h3>List the skills required for your project. How feasible will it be to find these skills?</h3>
						<p>Experience in relational database systems specifically in MySQL are required to create the database for the service, a frontend written in ReactJS and a backend layer that can parse data from the google maps API will need to be written. Experience and previous knowledge in AWS DevOps is needed to manage the hardware stack and some custom components for React will need to be written for social platform features like a trending tab. </p>
						<p>These skills are very feasible to find in the modern day as DevOps and AWS have become massive pillarstones in the currrent state of the web, many tutorials exist out there to train juniors, and the job market is already growing rapidly. </p>
						<h3>If the project is successful, what will be the outcome?</h3>
						<p>If the Global project is successful, the app will slowly generate data that can be used in the future to aid historians in figuring our what activities were occuring at any location at any time without any of the digital clutter and mishaps other social platforms have. The app will reinforce and encourage users to go to physical venues and areas and meet with friends rather than the isolation behaviour other platforms use to farm engagement. This is not only beneficial for the user but for external agencies such as advertisement businesses who can be sold more data related to the geolocation of users which can be collected to more accurately provide targeted advertisements. This project not only boosts the mental health of users, but creates easy archives for historians and helps contributes to the modern semantic economy.</p>
